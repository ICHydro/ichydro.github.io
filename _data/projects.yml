    description: "Climate Change Resilient Equitable Healthy Cities in Africa (CLARITY-Africa) aims to strengthen climate change resilience in African cities. The project works in Accra and Tamale (Ghana) and Kigali and Musanze (Rwanda) to better understand the effects of climate change on population health, city infrastructure, work and industry, sanitation and schools. Using sensors, surveys, imaging and satellite data, the research helps identify strategies to mitigate climate-change-induced health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups and outdoor workers."

The project focuses on coastal and riverine flooding due to sea level rise, developing improved policy and governance structures to reduce social, economic and environmental damages from climate change. Co-designed with communities and agencies, the project includes hydrological modelling, data systems for decision-making, capacity development, and citizen science observatories to create a CARICOM Flood Resilience Framework."
