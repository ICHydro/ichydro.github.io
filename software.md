## Hydrological analysis in R, Python, Matlab, and others


<p>Over the years, we've written quite a bit of software. Any code that we think may be useful for others is hosted on our <a href="https://github.com/ICHydro">Github page</a>. Some projects worth mentioning are:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/ICHydro/topmodel">Topmodel</a> is an implementation of the hydrological model TOPMODEL as a dynamic library, wrapped into an R package.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ICHydro/r_fuse">r_fuse</a> is an R implementation of the FUSE hydrological modelling framework.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/ICHydro/riverlabs">Riverlabs</a> project hosts the software for our Riverlabs suite of low-cost water quantity and quality sensors.</li>
</ul><p>Many group members have their own Github page. For example, previous group member <a href="https://github.com/cvitolo">Claudia Vitolo</a> has built produced several R packages.</p>
