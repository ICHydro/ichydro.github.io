### Details

- Full title: Citizen Science for Landslide Risk Reduction and Disaster Resilience building in Mountain Regions
- Funder: NERC/DFID [Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR)](https://www.shear.org.uk/) programme (grant number NE/P000452/1)

### Summary

We aim to increase local disaster resilience in remote mountainous environments by bringing together world-leading scientists on mountain hydrometeorology and landslide risk with experts on citizen science, participatory approaches to knowledge generation, and risk governance. We aim to deliver an end-to-end solution to the generation of locally actionable knowledge for disaster risk reduction, addressing the full workflow of information generation, processing, and communication to decision makers. Our proposition is that maximum impact is created if end-users are involved from the start in this process, using a bottom-up and participatory approach. For this, we will leverage recent advances in in-situ and remotely sensed monitoring, risk modelling and forecasting, vulnerability assessment, and risk governance.

Main Scientific Objectives:

1. Increase local disaster resilience in a remote mountainous region of Western Nepal, making use of participatory approaches to knowledge generation via citizen science
2. Map and model landslide risk and vulnerability along the Seti River in the Karnali Basin
3. Combine community-based environmental sensing with satellite data to generate maps and forecast landslide triggers
4. Develop local early warning systems and assimilate multiple data sources by developing new web-based methods for data processing and modelling
5. Disseminate Landslide EVO project knowledge in South Asia
