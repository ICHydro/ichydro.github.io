### Featured Projects

**Diagnosing controls of pollution hot spots and their impact on catchment water quality**

This project pioneers innovations in experimental analytics, data science and mathematical modelling to understand the dynamic drivers of multi-contaminant pollution hotspots and hot moments in river systems. The research aims to inform adaptation and mitigation strategies for river pollution.

*Led by Prof. Stefan Krause, University of Birmingham | Funded by UK NERC*

**Water Security and Climate Change Adaptation in Peruvian Glacier-Fed River Basins (RAHU)**

RAHU addresses water security concerns in the tropical Andes by monitoring glacier-ecosystem-livelihood interactions in the Vilcanota-Urubamba Basin, Peru. The project works with local partners and policy stakeholders to implement robust adaptation strategies.

*Led by Imperial College London | Funded by UK NERC and CONCYTEC Peru*
